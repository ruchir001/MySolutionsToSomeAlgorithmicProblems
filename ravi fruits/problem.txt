Given integers n and k. where n represents the height of the pyramid and K represents the size of box(here K represents the maximum number of oranges that can be stored in one single box). Now you are given infinite number of boxes with one condition

you can use the box only when you can completely fill the box with the oranges ( i.e no partial filling is allowed)
You have to arrange the oranges into the boxes . After arranging the oranges into the boxes print the remaining oranges

please refer the below image for how the oranges are arranged for n=3

In the image first layer contains 1 orange . second layer contains 3 oranges and third layer contains 6 oranges . so total oranges are 10 for n=3

Input format:

First line contains T represents the number of testcases

Next T lines contains value of N and K

Output format:

For each test case print the total oranges mod K

Contranits :

0 <N< 10 ^3

0 <K <10^3
