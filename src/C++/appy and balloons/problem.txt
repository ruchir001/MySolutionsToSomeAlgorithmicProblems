Appy loves balloons! She wants you to give her balloons on each of NN consecutive days (numbered 11 through NN); let's denote the number of balloons Appy wants on day ii by AiAi. The problem is that you only have MM balloons. Fortunately, you can give her candies instead of balloons as well. On each day ii, Appy accepts BiBi candies per each balloon you do not give her — formally, if you give Appy XiXi balloons on day ii, then you have to give her Ci=max(0,Ai−Xi)⋅BiCi=max(0,Ai−Xi)⋅Bi candies as well.

Your task is to minimize the maximum number of candies you give Appy on some day — find the minimum possible value of max(C1,C2,C3,...,CN)max(C1,C2,C3,...,CN).

Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NN and MM.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,ANA1,A2,…,AN.
The third line contains N space-separated integers B1,B2,…,BNB1,B2,…,BN.
Output
Print a single line containing one integer — the minimum value of max(C1,C2,C3,...,CN)max(C1,C2,C3,...,CN).
