You are given positive integers N and D. You may perform operations of the following two types:

add D to N, i.e. change N to N+D
change N to digitsum(N) 
Here, digitsum(x)digitsum⁡(x) is the sum of decimal digits of xx. For example, digitsum(123)=1+2+3=6digitsum⁡(123)=1+2+3=6 and digitsum(100)=1+0+0=1digitsum⁡(100)=1+0+0=1.

You may perform any number of operations (including zero) in any order. Please find the minimum obtainable value of NN and the minimum number of operations required to obtain this value.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer TT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NN and DD.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers — the minimum value of NN and the minimum required number of operations.


Example Input
3
2 1
9 3
11 13
Example Output
1 9
3 2
1 4
Explanation
Example case 1: The value N=1N=1 can be achieved by 8 successive "add" operations (changing NN to 1010) and one "digit-sum" operation.
